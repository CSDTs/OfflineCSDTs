Additional Files/Scripts to convert site to offline


CSDT Offline Automatic Conversion Version 2.1.0 (located in csdt_static)

Compiles all the recent changes made to the static files, and replaces project/application/header links for offline users.

Version Notes: 
* Since Pre Columbian Pyramids, Ethnobotanical, Woven Heaven Tangled Earth, and African Fractals have unique link replacement, they are not included in the bundle...
* Replaces generic navbar links to a 'offline' page redirect.

Future Updates:
* Include conditions for the remainder of the tools
* Replace navigation links for single page applications]
* Simplify navigation bar to indicate offline
* Since there are some needed files that have to carry over, it would be nice to generate these.
* Add conditions to allow for single tool conversions
* More ease of use for Mac, PC, and Chromebook users...

How to Use: 
sh offline.sh (Inside of csdt_static)
